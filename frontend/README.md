FleetCare UI prototype
=====================

This is a minimal React + Vite project implementing:
- Onboard, Login, Forgot email, OTP, Reset password, Signup pages.
- Admin and Staff dashboards with a collapsible animated sidebar.
- Management pages: Vehicles, Users, Drivers, Trips, Maintenance.

How to run:
1. unzip and cd into the project.
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- This is a UI prototype with frontend-side routing only (no backend).
- Sidebar animation: toggle button collapses it to icon-only mode.
